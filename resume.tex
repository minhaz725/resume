	{Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a popular and widely adopted symmetric key encryption algorithm.It is commonly used in a lot of ways, including wireless security, processor security, file encryption, and SSL/TLS. In fact, your web browser probably used AES to encrypt your connection with this website:This Python written AES algo uses repeat cycles or "rounds". There are 10, 12, or 14 rounds for keys of 128, 192, and 256 bits, respectively.Implementation details can be found in the presentation slide shared in the repo.}
